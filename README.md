## 3.Model Description
- Registration: This model enables users to create an account on the website by providing their necessary credentials such as name, rollno, email address, department, year of study, profile picture and password. The registration process ensures that each user has a unique account and can access the features of the system.
- Sell Products: Users can utilize this model to list and sell products they want to offer to their peers. They can provide details about the product, such as its product name, product type, description, price and any accompanying images. Other users visiting the website can view these listed products and potentially make a purchase.
- Rent Products: This model allows users to rent products from their peers for a specified duration. Users can search for products they are interested in renting, view the rental terms set by the owner (including the rental price and duration), and initiate a rental transaction. The owner and renter can then coordinate the logistics and finalize the rental agreement.
- Request Products: Users can utilize this model to make specific product requests to their peers. They can specify product name, product type, description and ownership duration. For example, if a user is looking for a particular book or electronic device, they can create a request specifying the details of the desired item. Other users who have the requested product can view the request and choose to fulfill it by offering their item for sale or rent.
- Donate Products: This model enables users to donate products they no longer need. They can list the products they want to donate, providing relevant information about the item. Other users who are interested in receiving donated items can view these listings and express their interest in receiving them.
- View Products: This model allows users to browse and view the products available for sale, rent, or donation. Users can search for products by category, filter results based on their preferences, and access detailed information about each product. This feature helps users explore the available options and make informed decisions.
- Chat: The chat model facilitates communication between users within the system. Users can exchange messages with each other to discuss product details, negotiate prices, clarify rental terms, or coordinate any other aspects related to buying, selling, renting, or donating products. The chat feature enhances user interaction and helps them reach mutually beneficial agreements.
- My Profile: This model provides users with a centralized dashboard to view and manage their profile information and product-related activities. It allows users to access a summary of their products, including those available for sale, rent, and products they have requested. Users can see a summary of their product listings, including the number of products they have listed for sale, rent, or requested. Users can view and make changes to the products they have listed for sale, for rent or requested products. They can edit the product details, update the pricing, add or remove images, and modify any other relevant information. This will be automatically updated in the database.
- Forgot password: This model provides users with a mechanism to reset their passwords in case they forget or cannot access their existing password. It ensures that users can regain access to their accounts and maintain the security of their personal information.
